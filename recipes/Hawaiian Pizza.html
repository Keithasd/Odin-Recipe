    pineapple that has a slight smoky flavor.
    <p>

    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for pan</li>
        <li>2 slices applewood-smoked bacon</li>
        <li>4 canned pineapple rings</li>
        <li>pound fresh pizza dough, at room temperature</li>
        <li>½ cup pizza sauce</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>¼ cup thinly sliced red onion</li>
        <li>4 slices Canadian bacon, cut into 1-inch triangles</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C) with a rack in the lower position.
            <p>Oil a large rimmed baking sheet with olive oil.</p></li>
        <li><p>Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add bacon and cook, flipping</p>
            <p>occasionally, until golden brown and crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a paper</p>
            <p>towel-lined plate.</p></li>
        <li>Pour out pan drippings without wiping pan clean, and return skillet to heat. Add
            <p>pineapple, cook until lightly browned and caramelized, 3 minutes per side.</p>
            Remove from pan. Chop bacon and cut pineapple rings into 3/4-inch pieces.
        </li>
        <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll dough to a 12-inch circle and place on the oiled
            <p>baking sheet. Prick dough with a fork several times to reduce air bubbles.</p>
            Spread pizza sauce evenly over dough, leaving a 1 1/2-inch border around
            <p>edges. Sprinkle with cheese, red onion, Canadian bacon, chopped pineapple,</p>
            and chopped bacon.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbly, toppings are lightly
            <p>charred, and crust is golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes before</p>
            serving.
        </li>
        
    </ol>
